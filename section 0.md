# What is this project?

In mid-July, [Wikimedia Australia noted that](https://twitter.com/wm_au/status/1679658885790187521/), every March since 2014, there appears to be a spike in active editors on the English Wikipedia. A few explanations were proposed in the thread, but nothing concrete.

At the time, I was interested in both more accurately quantifying this seasonality and identifying its root cause, but was busy and wasnâ€™t able to put much time into it. Now, however, I have some time to look more clearly at this topic.

There are two primary questions involved:
1. What are the features and magnitude of this seasonality?
2. What are its likely causes?

This project documents my process in answering these questions.
